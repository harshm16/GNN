### training.py : Used to train the model using Ncaltech101 and Ncars dataset.
### validate.py : Used to validate the trained model.
### model_binary_codes.py : Should be present inside model/networks folder under the original directory structure. Uses Binary Code kernel to attain the Diffusion Operator.
### model_euclidean_distance.py: Should be present inside model/networks folder under the original directory structure. Uses Euclidean Distance kernel to attain the Diffusion Operator.
